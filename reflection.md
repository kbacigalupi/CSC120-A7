- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


In the house class, I decided to overload the moveIn() class and the constructor. I wrote a default constructor as well as a constructor that only takes in the name and the number of floors. I chose this because I can never remember the address of houses and it's relatively arbitrary to me as a student who walks from place to place by memory/feel. 

In the Cafe class, I overloaded the constructor as well. There are now 4 constructors. One is basic/default, the second is the cafe part without the coffee ingredients (if coffee is not being sold), the third is everything but the address because again, I never remember the address of anywhere, and the last is potentially a virtual cafe-no address or floors but everything else. 

In the Library class, I overloaded the method that adds titles to be able to add a bunch of titles at once in the form of an arraylist. I also overloaded the constructor method to allow an address to be excluded.

It worked to work on the override methods first because it was clear exactly what we were supposed to do. It was hard to think of what to overload and why. I felt like I could solve one problem by overriding the restock method, but then I realized all of the variable types are the same (and in passing in one integer the computer has no idea which attribute I intend to be set/changed.) I feel like I wasn't very creative in which methods I decided to overload because it made the most sense to me to overload the constructor. Finally, I'm still not exactly the path that the computer goes through in using the overloaded constructor.
